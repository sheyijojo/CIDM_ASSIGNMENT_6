I am changing my domain model.

I am building a simple API to serve a machine learning based statistical language model using spaCy and Flask in Python!

This is a second review of my domain model.
Still need some refinement as I continue to code 

Not using the below domain model anymore
The business inovation is to autogenerate prices for logistics service needs based on the type of priducts
Order, Customer and Price are the main classes for this model.
